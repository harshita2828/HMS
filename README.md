Hospital Management System

This project demonstrates the use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) concepts to build a Hospital Management System. It allows the management of patients, doctors, and appointments through a database system, enabling functionalities like adding and viewing patient and doctor details, booking appointments, and checking doctor availability.


Usage Instructions

Set up the Database: Create the required tables (Patients, Doctors, Appointments) in your MySQL or preferred SQL database.
Configure Database Connection: Ensure the JDBC connection string in the Hospital Management System project is configured to match your database connection details.
Run the Project: Once the database is set up and connected, run the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) and interact with the system via the console or GUI (if implemented).


Technologies Used

Java (Core Java for building the system)
JDBC (For database interaction)
SQL (MySQL or any other relational database)


Conclusion

This project serves as a small-scale demonstration of core Java development concepts. It was developed with the help of a YouTube video tutorial. In the future, the project will be further developed to become more user-friendly and feature-rich, with improvements like a graphical user interface (GUI), better error handling, and enhanced functionalities for a more seamless user experience.
